Most of our important work is published on these online books:

+ [![Jupyter Book Badge][jupyterbooks-img]][samuel1-book-link] [SAMueL-1 project][samuel1-book-link] (complete)
+ [![Jupyter Book Badge][jupyterbooks-img]][samuel2-book-link] [SAMueL-2 project][samuel2-book-link] (ongoing)


__Related GitHub organisations__

Some of the SAMueL-2 work is also shared between other projects, and some code will be packaged up and stored elsewhere. The following organisations will one day store that content:
+ [stroke-modelling](https://github.com/stroke-modelling)
+ [stroke-optimist](https://github.com/stroke-optimist)
+ [stroke-digital-twin](https://github.com/stroke-digital-twin)

As of November 2023, the public repositories here are the following:
